I'm Arland Torres, and I like building things that solve user problems (mostly mine). Here are a couple things about me:

- Currently work in tech retail
- Full-stack JS/Python background
- Diploma in Software Development from Code Institute â€” check out my CI portfolio here

This is my personal blog, where I aim to write about my programming journey, weekend hacking, and general thoughts, brain dumps, and explorations
